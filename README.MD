# Student Expense Tracker 

Here are some of the prompts that I told Copilot:

- I want to add a bar graph that tracks how much is being spent on each day using the data I enter. I want the x axis to be the day and date and the y axis to be the amount i am spending.

- Is it possible to make the color of the bar different colors based on the category, like food can be green and other categories will be different colors

One suggestion I followed Copilot’s suggestion to abbreviate the labels on my x-axis, so the days are shortened and the chart looks less cluttered and easier to read.
